### The 3-Step Process for Adding a New Item Check

1.  **Define the Location (`Locations.py`)**
    *   Give the new check a unique name and ID.

2.  **Place the Location (`Regions.py`)**
    *   Put the new check into the region where it exists.

3.  **Set its Rule (`Rules.py`)**
    *   Define how the player can access it.
    *   *(Hint: For many checks, this rule is very simple if just reaching the region is the only requirement.)*
