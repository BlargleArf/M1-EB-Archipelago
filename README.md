# Mother 1 (EarthBound Beginnings) Archipelago Randomizer

This is an in-development Archipelago world for the NES game *Mother 1*, also known as *EarthBound Beginnings*.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a fully-featured multi-game randomizer for Mother 1. This will allow players to connect their game to a larger Archipelago multiworld, where key items and progression are shuffled between Mother 1 and dozens of other supported games.

A player in Mother 1 might find an Energy Tank for a friend playing Super Metroid, while that friend might find one of Ninten's Eight Melodies in the depths of Brinstar.

## Current Status

This APWorld is currently in active development. The core logic for progression, including the Eight Melodies and all major key items, has been implemented. Player-configurable options for required melodies and the Franklin Badge are also complete.
