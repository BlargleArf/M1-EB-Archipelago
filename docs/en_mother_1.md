# Mother 1 (EarthBound Beginnings)

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options?game=Mother_1) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

In this randomizer, the eight melodies required to finish the game have been scattered throughout the world, placed in the item locations of other games. In their place, you will find items and abilities that will help you and your friends in their own games.

Key items required for progression, such as the Zoo Key and the Pass for the train, are also shuffled into the multiworld. You will need to rely on other players to find the tools you need to explore the world of Mother 1.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any item listed as `progression` or `useful` in the game's options are shuffled into the multiworld. This includes the Eight Melodies and all key items required to access new areas. Important gear, like the Franklin Badge, may also be found in other worlds.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When you receive an item, it will be instantly added to Ninten's inventory. A message will appear on screen for a few seconds indicating what item you received and which player sent it to you.
